An old school project

This was the project of my second to last year of school ("1Ã©re" in french).
The concept was to do anything that has something to do with math/biology/phisics as long as it is well done and presented.
We were three on the project and didn't had much time for it. But after all, it turned great and I'm quite satisfied with it today.
Like all Dev's, I tell myself: " There is a thousand other way i could have done it differently and better ". But it was and oddly satisfying project.
I hope you will see it the way I looked at it when I was that age.
